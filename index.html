  <h2>HTML</h2> <!-- This tag h2 is an example of a header -->
  <p>HTML stands for <b>hypertext markup language.</b><br> It creates what you are able to see (and not see) on websites.

  </p>
  
  <h2>Elements</h2>
  <p>HTML <b>elements</b> help make up a web page and enable it to act in distinct ways.</p>
  <h3>Tags</h3>
  <p><b>Tags</b> manipulate the text/code to enable it to become <b>bold</b>, to add an <img src="http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/jadensadventures/images/c/c7/VeTl4V1.png/revision/latest?cb=20141007160851" alt="spongebob jumping with joy"><br>
  image or by adding <a href="www.fakeurl.com">links</a> to a website.<br> Some tags are considered to be <i>void</i> because they do not need<br>
  a closing tag.</p>
  
  <h4>Inline or Block?</h4>
  <p><b>Block</b> elements differ from <b>inline</b> elements because they put a "box" around its content.
  <h4>Span or Div?</h4>
  <p>What makes these two elements different is that <b>span</b> is <i>inline</i> while <b>div</b> are <i>block</i>.</p>
  
  <div class="one">
  <h1> What I Learned from Stage 1/2 </h1>
  </div>

   <!-- A div element is used to group content together and attach particular styles to specific div -->
  <h2> How to Create a Structured Document </h2>
   <p> To create a structured document, you need HTML, CSS and Javascript. Each of these create the webpage and allow it to do different things. HTML is the content, CSS is the style of the content and Javascript makes webpages interactive for the user. </p>
    
    <h3>Boxes</h3>
    <p> Webpage structure is similar to a tree. Each element can have other elements that "Branch" off and have elements within them. However, these elements are contained in boxes that separate each element from one another.</p> 
    
    <h3>Text Editors</h3>
    <p>Text editors are used by programmers to help write code easier. Many programs, such as Sublime Text, can create closing tags when writing an opening tag. It can also help indicate where you might've made a mistake by changing the colors of the text.</p> 

<div class="three"> 
<h1>What I learned from Stage 3</h1></div>

<h2>CSS</h2>
<p><em>CSS</em> stands for Cascading Style Sheets. In CSS, the order of the code matters, since the top most code overrules all. Inheritance helps prevent repitition in the overall code.</p>

<h2>Box Model</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Center: Content - what is appearing on the website</li>
  <li>Padding: clears an area around content, affected by background color</li>
  <li>Border: inherited from color property of box</li>
  <li>Margin: transparent - space between boxes</li>
</ul>
<p>Element width = Border+Padding+content+Padding+border</p>

<h2>Code/test/refine</h2>
<ol type="1">
  <li>Look for natural boxes</li>
  <li>Look for repeated styles/elements</li>
  <li>Write HTML</li>
  <li>Apply styles (Biggest to smallest)</li>
  <li>Fix things - look on other browsers</li>
</ol>
